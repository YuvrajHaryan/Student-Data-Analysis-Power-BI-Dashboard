# Student-Data-Analysis-Power-BI-Dashboard

Using the University Students Dataset as a starting point for a Business Intelligence (BI) 
analysis is a calculated step into the world of academic data. The aim of this analysis is to 
gather insightful data that will help decision-makers, optimize educational strategies and 
improve the educational experience for all students. This analysis focuses on extracting
actionable knowledge from the dataset by closely examining assessments, courses, student data, 
and virtual learning activities. This will help make well-informed decisions in the everchanging world of higher education.

The report seeks to answer the following questions:
1. How does the student's previous education level impact their performance? (KPI: Average 
score based on highest education level)
2. How well do students are making use of the Virtual Learning Environment (VLe) ?
3. Are there any trends in the way students use the VLe and are there any resource types that 
are popular among students?
4. Is there any trend in the way of students choosing the courses?
5. From what region are most of the students at the University?
6. Can a portal-like page where all the student data is viewed at a glance can be made using 
power BI?
